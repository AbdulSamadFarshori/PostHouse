They had a shared interest in energy and the climate, and were fascinated by this new technology that could provide near limitless clean energy.A decade later, they were surprised at how little solar they saw on UK roofs. The technology had improved significantly; cheaper, sleeker and more efficient. It was incredible to see how it had progressed. While researching solar for their own homes, they learned that prices were in the tens of thousands, making it unaffordable. And they discovered they weren\u2019t alone in their thinking: 70% of UK households wanted it but only 4% had gone solar.Meanwhile, in the US, Germany and the Netherlands, household solar had grown rapidly, driven by solar subscription models. It was affordable, offered total peace of mind and was hassle-free \u2014 a no-brainer for customers.Taking everything they\u2019d learned from careers in finance and entrepreneurship, they founded Sunsave in 2022 with a simple mission: make solar accessible to all UK households by launching the UK\u2019s first solar subscription.Our sourcesSolar can help the UK\u2019s energy crisisIn recent years, the UK has seen just how expensive and unreliable it can be to heavily depend on gas for electricity. Nobody can predict the future, but with energy prices forecast to stay high until the late 2030s, and electricity consumption expected to increase 50% by 2035, it\u2019s clear we\u2019re going to need other energy sources.That\u2019s where solar comes in. Panels and batteries are now cheaper and more efficient, making solar a cheaper form of energy \u2014 with the potential to free the UK from a costly and temperamental gas-powered grid. But there\u2019s one huge problem: the average solar system costs \u00a310,270, and half of UK households have less than \u00a35,000 in savings.Our sourcesThe UK\u2019s first solar subscriptionWe\u2019ve created Sunsave Plus, which doesn\u2019t require a one-off lump sum. Instead, it\u2019s a subscription where you can pay for solar with a fixed monthly payment. The best part? You\u2019ll save on your energy bills immediately.Not only are we making solar more accessible, we\u2019re making it simple, too. We\u2019ve selected the best kit in the market for you and combined it in one easy package, with a 20-year Sunsave Guarantee. This kit works seamlessly together, looks great and will last for years to come.Government-backedWe\u2019ve been awarded \u00a32.2m from the UK government via its Green Home Finance Accelerator initiative to fund the research, development and launch of Sunsave Plus.Our investorsWe\u2019ve raised over \u00a39.2 million from leading venture capital funds Norrsken and Plug and Play (who backed Paypal, Google and Airbnb), well known angel investors like Stuart Rose (Chairman of Asda), Michael Spencer (Founder of Nex Group/ICAP) and renowned industry leader, Bill Nussey (Author of \u2018Freeing Energy\u2019).Our valuesCustomer focusedOur dedicated team will always be here to support you, whether you need help next month or in ten years\u2019 time.Built to lastWe only use the best kit and installation processes. We don\u2019t take shortcuts, and we exceed every industry body\u2019s guidelines when it comes to quoting and installing solar.Mission drivenWe\u2019re on a mission to make solar accessible to all UK households. Because going green shouldn\u2019t cost the earth.TransparencyWe want the UK to go solar, but it doesn\u2019t make financial sense for everyone. We\u2019ll always tell you if we don\u2019t think solar\u2019s right for your home. Our journey so farRaised significant fundingFrom 2022-2023, we raised \u00a39.2 million from established venture capital funds that invested in Google, Airbnb and PayPal, plus successful investors like Stuart Rose, Chairman of Asda, and industry leader Bill Nussey, author of Freeing Energy.Government backingIn May 2023, we received a \u00a3200,000 grant from the UK government via its Green Home Finance Accelerator (GHFA) initiative to fund the research and development of our solar subscription. In January 2024, this was followed up by a further \u00a32 million to launch Sunsave Plus.Endorsed by Which?In September 2023, the independent experts at Which? put us to the test and endorsed Sunsave as a Trusted Trader, demonstrating that we\u2019re one of the highest quality solar installers around.Received FCA approvalWe also got authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in September 2023, which means we can now offer our groundbreaking solar subscription to UK households.Octopus partnershipIn October 2023, we partnered with Octopus to help our customers access their market-leading smart export tariffs.Moved to Clerkenwell, LondonIn April 2024, we left the hustle and bustle of Chinatown, Soho for the calmer streets of Clerkenwell. The Sunsave team is now 30 people strong, with decades of experience in the solar industry and leading tech companies.Our teamWe\u2019ve got a brilliant team of 30+ people with a wide range of backgrounds. Together, we have decades of solar industry knowledge, plus experience building world-changing products at companies like Monzo, OVO and Deliveroo.We\u2019re driven by our mission to make the power of solar accessible to all UK households, helping them take control of their energy bills, and creating a cleaner, greener Britain.Interested in joining?

I've purchased my PV panels and battery from them and they are really great from start to finish. I think they are great value for money and they really look after you. Would highly recommend.Katherinea year agoSpectra provide an outstanding level of service. I received a prompt and detailed quote to my enquiry, an honest and instructive site visit, an installation plan with dates they adhered to, really good polite and helpful guys (their own employees, not sub-contractors) for the install, and finally prompt documentation which enabled me to set up the correct tariffs with Octopus.  I cannot fault them.jon wadea year agoAbsolutely fantastic company to deal with.We obtained a few quotes from different companies but these guys really shone through! Far more knowledgeable and customer focused than others, they went above and beyond from the initial quotation until commissioning. Installation was completed within a day and as an electrician and previously a solar installer myself, I can say the quality of workmanship is 5*Wouldn't hesitate in recommending Spectra to anyone wanting solar and battery storage installed on their property.Nicholas Chamberlaina year agoExcellent from start to finish, I contacted them based on online reviews and they didn't disappoint. After a brief conversation about my property and needs they sent over 2 well documented quotes that contained everything I could possibly want to know and left it with me, there was no pushy sales or constant follow up emails, the ball was completely left with me.After contacting them to agree to go ahead with the installation, a survey was quickly dealt with by one of their agents. He was extremely knowledgeable and friendly, quickly helped identify where things would be installed and how things on the day would go.The office team dealt with everything very quickly and kept us informed about what was going on and what we needed to do.On the day of the install the team showed up around 8am and where done around 5pm. The were very friendly and professional and I couldn't praise them more.After sales were great, there was a slight issue with the inverter which was dealt with the same day I contacted them.Honestly, I cannot praise this company enough and would recommended them to everyone.GREvana year agoFantastic family run company. Mike and Jonathan always have time for me when I call or text. Months after installation they still help me out.Even got my parents to use them for their own install.Highly recommended.craig towlera year agoAfter having spoken to several other companies I came across Spectra, not only did they better the price of the others, they offered far longer warranties on the equipment. I\u2019ve just had the system installed and am extremely impressed. Their customer service is excellentStephan Gardnera year agoI tend to do a lot  of research before I do any project - especially one of this expense so I did spend weeks trawling the internet and watching videos, reading articles and visiting government websites.I had three companies come and visit me all of which were local to me and from Yorkshire (normally a must for me).... then I rang Spectra and the friendly voice on the phone put me through to Jonathan.All I can say is that from that moment I felt that Jonathan placed me in safe hands - he guided me through the process and it became pretty clear that two of the three quotes I'd had were very much focused on getting a quick install and ease for them - not what was right for me.Jonathan and his team did an amazing job - they explained everything, gave me the options I wanted and did exactly as they said they would - on time for the scaffolding, the installation took two days and the monitoring was a breeze.A full set of documents came through one week after the installation was complete and I feel very grateful for having selected Spectra rather than some of my friends who had selected companies not as honest (and some not in business anymore).I had 16 solar panels installed on a slate roof, with bird and vermin protection, in the loft was an inventor by Lux and 3 x 3.2kw batteries then an external fuse box in white to match the electricity and gas boxes - perfect!The icing on the cake was the tree certificate I received today which was a really nice gesture to show how much they care for the customer and the environment.Highly recommended and I will be using them again when I change to an electric vehicle and to add more batteries at a later stage!Andrew Fishera year agoWhat a great experience with the Spectra Solar team. Always ready to answer my many questions and no pushy sales. Their quality and price do the talking so there's no need for other tactics.  Great installation by the team and all tidy!  Looking forward to seeing the benefits, albeit in better weather than today (heavy rain!)Andrew Johnsona year agoExcellent communication would highly recommend spectre Solar excellent standard of work from start to finishDaniel Molyneuxa year agoWell, what can I say! A*!From start to finish Jonathan and the team have been amazing. The installation team where very friendly and tidy, also considerate as on the day of install, unfortunetly, I had a family funeral to attend in the afternoon. They was accommodating, and went through all questions they would have needed answers for throughout the day all in the morning instead, explained everything. Upon my return in the late afternoon, the job was completed to high standards.It is a big expensive soalr panels and battery storage, but I can assure you, I felt 100% in safe hands throughout the entire processes.Thank you again all, best regards, Dan & JenGavin Edensora year agoVery happy I went with Spectra Solar. The lads worked so hard all day and got in completed on the same day. Customer service is great and knowledgable, any issues just ring them. They were also very competitive with the quote and reliable.Phil Sullivana year agoWe must have spoken to 10+ companies to install our solar/battery solution. It was much harder than we thought, even though we had a system installed at a previous house so had a rough idea what we wanted.Most companies were quite sales based and you couldn't always get the answers you wanted, or you got an answer and you weren't convinced. Then we came across Spectra - I hadn't initially seen them as they weren't in our immediate area.From first contact with Spectra, Jonathan was on the phone, with technical detail, for as long as you needed, giving ideas and suggestions. There was no hard sell or sales pitch, just advice - so refreshing - and great value too. And they really knew what they were talking about.We had 5.88kW of panels installed alongside 19.2Kwh of battery storage, plus an Eddi to take some excess power to the hot tank.They turned up when they said they would, Jordan & team didn't stop all day, did a really tidy job and cleaned up after themselves.The system is outperforming the guidance output, and is giving us lots of free electricity and hot water. Since it was put in 6 days ago, we've spent about 25p on actual electric and not had to heat the hot tank with the gas boiler at all. The Lux app & web portal monitoring are excellent.Spectra are also really responsive and helpful for anything you need - a great company and would not hesitate to recommend!Richarda year agoI've had my 7kw, 18 panel solar installation with a 4.8kw battery and solar iboost for my hot water tank for a year now.Firstly, I chose Spectra Solar as they were so helpful and got back to me with any queries or questions I had.Their pricing was excellent in comparison to others with no pressure to sign up at all as they aren't sales people, just very helpful.My bills for both gas and electricity in 2021/22 were about \u00a31,400 before the panels were installed.After the installation and for the year 2022/23 they have been \u00a31,825, bearing in mind I would of paid about \u00a32,800 (estimated, but could easily be higher), especially as the daily charge has gone up so much (about \u00a3200 for the year) as well as the cost of the electricity and gas.I include gas as the iboost helps to heat my hot water tank instead of the gas boiler, so I save on some gas.I will be getting a cheque back from what I've exported of \u00a3400 from Eon as they are now paying 16.5 pence per Kw/H.Therefore, I calculate I've saved about \u00a31,375 in the first year, which I'm very happy with.I would highly recommend Spectra Solar.Below was my review from a year ago.I had my solar panels, batteries and iboost fitted today and it all looks very tidy and professional. Well done to all the fitters, who were very polite and got on with the job.From first sending my enquiry to Spectra Solar, Mike and Emma in the office got in touch with me straight away.  I was very impressed how quickly they responded to any questions and were available to speak too.The prices on their website made comparing quotes easy, and they were better value than some other companies I contacted.After agreeing I would go ahead, they sent someone out to make sure all was ok before the system was installed.Within a short timeframe a date was arranged and they came when they said they would.It\u2019s been hassle free and I am very pleased with the service they have provided.Well done to all at Spectra Solar, and yes, I would recommend them to anyone.adrian ward2 years agoAfter months and hours of investigation several firms later for Solar and battery installation we came across Spectra Solar. The in depth analysis of what solar and battery would generate for value was the best report we had received by far. Once we gave the go-a -head with no upfront charges the installation was the best quality and I'm not an easiest person to please. Well Done Spectra Solar and thanks again highly recommended, keep up the great team work.John Hayselden2 years agoFantastic company, helpful, friendly and fair. Gave me some really good advice helping me to choose the right system for our needs. Jonathan really knows the market and had some great advice. The lads turned up on time and worked like Trojans to get the job finished. Even their scaffold subcontractor was really helpful modifying the scaffold as an extra to allow some last minute chimney works. I've now kept my original 10 year old solar panels but they re wired them to resolve a water ingress problem. Did a really neat job, finished with well fitted bird mesh protection. We also had a 15 KW battery storage installed with separate inverter allowing me to store spare solar power and also charge on cheap overnight electricity. Coupled with the EV charger they installed I am now saving an average of \u00a38.00 per day over my old bills.Greg Herriott2 years agoGetting solar and batteries installed is a big, expensive decision, so not one to be taken lightly. After weeks of research and contacting every company that would service our area, I just got a good feeling about Spectra. They were the only company that sounded like they actually knew what they were talking about and it wasn't just a salesperson who had been on a training course. I was able to ask very technical questions and get reliable answers. From first contact all the way through to installation, communication was excellent. The install day went very well. They arrived bang on time and got straight on with it. Very friendly crew who were very professional and had great attention to detail.Within a day the whole system was up and running. Even though I did have a fault with my inverter 1 week later (just a dodgy unit..which I've been told is only 1 of 3 out of the hundreds they have installed), within 48 hours of me contacting them (on the weekend) I had a brand new inverter installed within 30 minutes. No quibble, no fuss.I really cannot rate these guys high enough. Do not go with a big national company. You are just another number to them. Go with Spectra Solar and you will not be disappointed as they actually career about their customers.Thanks very much guys.Richard Johnson3 years agoI contacted a number of companies and this one stood out. Great service from quote to install. Brilliant team of people. Today I had my 6 x 405W + 4.8KW battery installed. Great value for money as well.Brian Murphy3 years agoVery professional team of people, From quotation to installation.After accepting the proposal a date was agreed. The team arrived on time and had the system up and running in about 6hrs.I would recommend this company to anyone.Roy Shakespeare3 years agoSpectra solar visited me this morning to investigate my non working solar system. In less than one hour the problem was sorted. The engineer was very pleasant and very thorough, testing all the components and quickly locating the problem, which was a faulty generation metre. A new metre was fitted and we are generating electricity once more. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Spectra to anybody. The cost was very reasonable as well. I am very pleased and relieved that it didn't cost me an arm and a leg. Thank you Shaun and Emma for a great service.Allen Moore3 years agoApart from some slight issues with scaffolding, out of their control, everything went as planned. Even though they were delayed by the scaffolding problem they kept me fully aware of progress and resolved all the issues. They worked later than usual to ensure the job was finished on the day. They worked hard, were very polite and cleaned up at the end of the day. Mike and Emma in the office were helpful and easy to talk to and dealt with the problems well. System is working well and feeding into the Grid and earning it's way.Noel Green3 years agoSolar and batteries installed, great service from initial contact to installation. Mike was very helpful and guided me through the process and options, no pressure salesman talk. Installation was completed on time and the installation team was very professional.I would highly recommend Spectra Solar.Isobel Langrishe3 years agoExcellent service and attention to detail. Mike and the team were professional, knowledgeable and patient with our million questions! Quality installation for a very reasonable price. We chose Spectra Solar because we wanted a company we would feel comfortable and confident contacting if we had any follow up issues or queries and we are entirely happy we made the right choice. They take pride in their work and are experts in their field. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend to everyone. Five star service ?.Jakub Jan Wilgosz3 years agoSpectra Solar was great to deal with from the initial contact all the way through to the installation of solar PV system with battery storage for our home (on both front and rear roofs). It was such a pleasure working with Mike. He always wanted us to be happy with the finished product and he worked diligently to make that happen. We approached 10 companies for quotes and Spectra Solar's represented the best value for money and was also quickly delivered (initial contact on 6th Mar 2022, installation on 13th May 2022 - would be sooner, but we were on holidays for a couple of weeks!). Mike and his contractors showed up on time, worked hard, cleaned up, and completed the work in a timely and professional manner. We are very happy with the end result, and our installation is performing very well. We would definitely recommend Spectra Solar and would use them again ourselves should the need arise in the future.aaron bailey3 years agoArrived on time for the survey and the installation and this is very important to me. Never any fuss and everything went to plan. Very happy so far with the results from the panels. Highly recommended with no hesitation.AJ Driveways3 years agoMike and his colleagues from Spectra Solar Ltd installed our solar system.Arrived on time even though I live a distance away.Truly a proffessional team, hard working and motivated.Best of all, no rip off quotes.No upfront payments, which thier competitors wanted between 10% and 50%.Overall a great experience.If you want quality work at very competitive prices look no further.Recommended to all...Brian and Mandy Prestatyn.Dez Futak3 years agoThis isn't an installation review - more just an opportunity to mention that, Mike, who handled my myriad of questions, was very direct & honest & not at all \"salesy\". A real breath of fresh air to hear someone more interested in what's best for you, rather than them.Sharon Allen3 years agoWe had spectra solar ltd do work for us today, i can honestly say i would recommend them to all my friends, their workmanship was brilliant, very efficent, very proffesional.Sonya Evans4 years agoThankyou for fitting the panels on my house.

On-roof is cheaper than In-roof due to the extra work involved.We recommend installing optimisers when in a potentially shaded area. Optimisers are also a good upgrade for existing solar PV systems to increase efficiency!Don\u2019t forget all our monocrystalline Solar PV panels we install have a 12-year manufacturer warranty and a 25-year linear performance guarantee! \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBattery Storage System \n\n\n\nThinking about battery storage and why?\u00a0It\u2019s simple, If you cant use all the free energy you produce it goes back to the grid for pennies! The worst part is you then buy it back later in the evening at full price when your panels aren\u2019t producing.But what if you could store your excess produced free energy and use it in the evening?This is exactly what a battery storage system is for, it is there to store your free produced energy for you to utilise it in the evening saving you money!Don\u2019t think lead-acid batteries like the ones in your car, these are Lithium-Iron types (LiFePO4) and they can store a whopping amount of kWh in each one! Just for info, a 3.2kWh battery can keep an average Tv on for approximately 32hrs so you can imagine what a few of these coupled together can keep running!Solar battery storage systems also go one step further, you can charge AUTOMATICALLY from an overnight tariff i.e Economy 7 or an EV tarrif from the likes of octopus energy!Currently receiving the FIT? (feed-in-tariff) Don\u2019t worry, these storage systems won\u2019t affect any of your payments, they will just save you more money!At Spectra Solar we take pride in being the market leaders in Solar Panel battery storage cost uk. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEV Charging \n\n\n\nUsing Solar PV to charge your car during the day? It makes sense to do so!We install Ev Chargers for your home or office that utilise excess power generated from your Solar PV System to charge your car thus reducing your carbon footprint even more.We currently install the well-known Zappi charger by myenergi or the ProjectEV range of chargers.

Warning light on? or just know your system has lost performance?This could be a number of issues from a faulty inverter, a damaged solar panel, or even a simple dirty panel. We can fix all these issues and increase the performance of your system.Many homeowners are starting to upgrade their existing systems by having solar edge optimisersfitted to their panels. Old inverters are replaced with a much more modern efficient design that enables the performance of the system to be improved dramatically. We can supply and install your upgrade and it will not affect any FIT tariff. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImmersion Diverter \n\n\n\nDo you have a hot water cylinder? If so you could use the solar PV system\u2019s excess energy to heat your hot water using a Solar Iboost. This clever add-on uses yourexcess produced energy to power your immersion heater and heat your water. Talk to our team today for more information. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolar Edge \n\n\n\nSolarEdge enables more energy generation from each solar module by mitigating power losses that result from mismatch between modules.

They require minimal maintenance and have a long lifespan.\nVersatility: Solar panels can be installed on rooftops, in open fields, or as part of solar farms. They are versatile and can be integrated into both urban and rural environments.\nSustainable Development: Solar power contributes to sustainable development by reducing dependence on finite fossil fuels, mitigating climate change, and promoting energy independence.\n\nAir Source Heat Pumps (ASHP):\n\nEfficiency: ASHPs are highly efficient in converting ambient air into heating or cooling. They can provide a cost-effective solution for both residential and commercial spaces.\nYear-Round Functionality: ASHPs can operate throughout the year, providing both heating in the winter and cooling in the summer. This dual functionality makes them versatile and suitable for various climates.\nReduced Carbon Footprint: ASHPs produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional heating systems, contributing to environmental sustainability and climate change mitigation.\nLower Operating Costs: ASHPs can result in lower operating costs compared to conventional heating systems, as they move heat rather than generate it. This can lead to energy savings over time.\nIncentives and Rebates: Many regions offer incentives and rebates for the installation of air source heat pumps, making them more financially attractive for homeowners and businesses.\n\nOther Renewable Energy Sources:\nWhile solar power and air source heat pumps offer significant advantages, it\u2019s important to briefly describe other renewable energy sources:\n\nWind Power: Harnessing the kinetic energy of the wind to generate electricity, with onshore and offshore wind farms as common installations.\nHydropower: Using flowing or falling water to generate electricity through dams, run-of-river systems, and tidal power.\nBiomass: Utilizing organic materials for heating, electricity generation, and biofuel production.\nGeothermal Energy: Tapping into the Earth\u2019s internal heat for electricity generation or direct heating, using geothermal power plants or heat pumps.\n\nEach renewable energy source has its unique benefits, and the choice depends on factors such as location, climate, and energy requirements.\nGet in touch with us today to start your renewable journey by filling out a quote request or giving us a call on 01942 669 601.\n\n\n\n\n\u2190 Previous PostNext Post \u2192\n \n\nLeave a Comment Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.
